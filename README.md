I'm a bit concerned that this will make me look unprofessional in future.  
Please ignore this repo. Thank you very much.

"cowcitizen" is a wordplay.  
In Korean, "cow" is "소", and "citizen" is "시민." Put together, they make up "소시민." It means "petit-bourgeois." Not that I am one; the wordplay itself was entertaining.  
Actually, I thought the word meant something around "A citizen who has no power". It turns out, dictionaries don't agree with me.  
I did consider changing my name, but I couldn't come up with a good alternative. So I decided to stick with this name.

I'm still learning to use git. This is my first try. This line was written from my computer. Can I push?
